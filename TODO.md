   { Updated internal_createDK240object.m to return status = 0 if an error is thrown which then
     forces user to turn on monochromator and restart program. }

- [ ] Update shutter radio button states to match shutter states on start up
- [ ] Update ~/LaserTable_msc_3_5_0/internal_run_experiment_lt.m NI routines                                 % DONE
- [ ] Attempt to make ABORT button abort experiment immediately using CsMl_AbortCapture()                    % DONE
- [ ] Merge updated ~/LaserTable_msc_3_6_0/internal_run_experiment_lt.m into the main script
- [ ] Reformat GUI - increase density, labelling and add version number                                      % DONE
- [ ] Find a suitable icon for the standalone executable                                                     % DONE
- [ ] Confirm that CsMl pipeline matches the pipeline presented in thesis script                             % DONE
- [ ] Rewrite some parts of LICENSE.md to reflect work done by DSW
- [ ] Remove ~/internal_byte2number.m & ~/internal_number2byte.m                                             % DONE
- [ ] Add a msgbox that indicates when an experiment has finished [Daina suggestion]                         % DONE

- [ ] Take one last look at TA/flourescence shutter control scheme and confirm proper operation
- [ ] Add drop down menu to manually select COM port for DK240/QC9514 (override default)
- [ ] Update acquisition loop to work with long timescales (!! _lt.m function) <- < 10 s (JJW email)         % DONE
- [ ] Update additional_features.txt & general_instructions.txt to reflect program changes
- [ ] Program in the stir stop feature for long timescale experiments
- [ ] REBUILD l_ts.m - 10 Hz laser pulse is being picked up by slow digitizer
- [ ] Should probably make some slight adjustments to the laser manual in the near future
- [ ] Throw in voltage error correction algorithm into acquisition loop terminus                             % DONE
- [ ] Make abort feature work in l_ts.m
