## Disclaimer
- _I am not a MATLAB expert_. Actually I learned MATLAB on the fly simply to fulfill the requirements of this project. **I acknowledge that this code is far from ideal** and I would have done many things differently now that I am more experienced.
- Some of this code was automatically generated using the MATLAB GUI editor.
- This code can likely very easily (and should) be broken up into individual `*.m` files.

## Description
Label | Description
----- | -----------
**A** |  Here the user chooses between fluorescence and TA mode.
**B** |  The user selects a timebase (i.e. time interval to sample starting from oscilloscope trigger).
**C** |  The number of blank and experimental laser flashes (see [Example for Laser Options parameters](#example-for-laser-options-parameters)).
**D** |  The number of groups of laser flashes (see [Example for Laser Options parameters](#example-for-laser-options-parameters)).
**E** |  The pause time between groups of shots (see [Example for Laser Options parameters](#example-for-laser-options-parameters)).
**F** |  The user selects the DK240 monochromator wavelength (sent as an SCPI command TO the DK240).
**G** |  The DK240 returns the ACTUAL wavelength back to the user.
**H** |  The user selects the slit width at the entrance of the DK240.
**I** |  The user selects the slit width at the exit of the DK240.
**J** |  The user selects the Hamamatsu PMT voltage.
**K** |  QC9514 Digital Delay Generator options. Note that these fields are filled automatically upon toggling **A**.
**L** |  This checkbox fires up the laser. The laser will not fire until all parameters have been selected.
**M** |  Convenience feature for programmatically controlling individual shutters.
**N** |  Convenience feature for programmatically controlling all shutters.
**O** |  Pressing the START button will begin an experiment.
**P** |  Pressing the ABORT button will immediately stop an experiment. **Use in case of a major safety issue arising during an experiment** or perhaps to abort an experiment if parameters were incorrectly chosen.
**Q** |  Exports signal averaged data as .csv to a directory of choosing.
**R** |  The results pane displaying the oscilloscope output.

## Example for Laser Options parameters
Note that in the [Layout](#layout) example, the "user" has indicated they wish to collect 3 groups of 25 shots and have inputted a delay time of 2 seconds. What does this mean? An oscilloscope reading the output of the PMT will first collect 25 reads with a shutter blocking the Nd:YAG laser from striking the sample cuvette. This is the blank read. The shutter will then open and the Nd:YAG laser will reach (and excite) the sample 25 times. The sample will emit light which will be picked up by the PMT/oscilloscope. The blank data will then be subtracted from the experimental data to yield corrected data. Corrected data will then be signal averaged. Recall that the user specified 3 groups of shots. The aforementioned sequence of events will now be repeated three times, with a delay of 2 seconds between each group. The figure below very nicely depicts this sequence of events:
