* THESE INSTRUCTIONS SERVE AS A VERY GENERAL OVERVIEW *

(1) Turn on both power bars
(2) Open air flow valve for shutter operation
(3) For TA experiments:
   (3.1) Turn on arc lamp power supply
         Set power to 65-70 W using current adjustment
   (3.2) Turn on arc lamp pulser and toggle Output Enable
   (3.3) Wait 5-10 minutes for arc lamp to stabilize
(4) Turn on Nd:YAG laser. Turn key to ON position on Continuum PSU
(5) Toggle Start/Stop and Open Shutter on Continuum PSU
(6) Start LaserTable GUI
(7) Select experiment type and then timebase
(8) Input number of shots N per S number
(9) Input number of shot groups S
(10) Select a pause time between each group of shots S
     This allows for relaxation of excited states in between collections
(11) Select a target wavelength of interest.
     The actual monochromator wavelength is returned in the field to the right
(12) Monochromator slit width may be adjusted in the fields below wavelength selection
(13) Digital Delay Generator parameters will be filled in automatically
     upon experiment type selection
(14) Put on safety glasses and check Start Pulse. This will start the laser!
(15) Hit the green START button. This will initialize data collection
(16) Data can be saved after collection to any directory by hitting Save Data?
