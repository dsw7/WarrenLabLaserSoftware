* This software comes with some additional features: *

(1) STIR ON
    This feature is used for controlling the magnetic stirrer
    Check STIR ON and rotate the knob on the grey box
    labelled STIR to the left
    * Check ATX power supply if stirrer does not turn on! *
    
(2) ABORT
    The red ABORT button stops the run as soon as iteration over the
    current group of shots S has terminated. This is NOT a safety feature
    but rather meant for early termination of faulty runs
    * NOTE THIS WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN ALL SYSTEMS ! *

(3) Shutter Control
    Manual shutter control can be exercised for troubleshooting
    purposes. All shutters can be opened or closed simultaneously as well
    and simply as a matter of convenience
