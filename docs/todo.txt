20. Merge updated ~/LaserTable_msc_3_6_0/internal_run_experiment_lt.m into the main script
21. Reformat GUI - increase density, labelling and add version number                                      % DONE
22. Find a suitable icon for the standalone executable                                                     % DONE

29. Add drop down menu to manually select COM port for DK240/QC9514 (override default)
30. Update acquisition loop to work with long timescales (!! _lt.m function) <- < 10 s (JJW email)         % DONE
31. Update additional_features.txt & general_instructions.txt to reflect program changes
32. Program in the stir stop feature for long timescale experiments
